Kiosk Sample
=====================

This an early (2013) sample of a touchscreen kiosk project built to provide a browsable interface for fashion items, with cart functionality and the ability to text the cart contents to a mobile phone (See http://skorupski.org/wiki/industry/ebay/kss ). It is built using NodeJS and a custom client-side (JSRender-based) templating and SPA architecture (before the transition to Angular in later projects). All API keys have been cleared, so this sample will not run without Splunk, Bit.ly, and Twilio API keys, required in the routes/index.js file.
