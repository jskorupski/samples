DesignDatabase
===========

An early version of an internal-only UI/UX cataloguing, auditing, and search tool. The goals of this system are to provide a centralized place to document, input, analyze, and compare UX/UI components, standards, and guidelines around the company for the purposes of consistency and cooperation. This project is based on AngularJS for the client side web interface, and NodeJS for the front-end server and tools. Data is stored in SOLR 4.10 instance. Some of the additional tools and code in this project are not included since they are specific to internal systems.
